# CheckWeatherAngular
Simple weather app, build with Angular TypeScript

# Prerequisites:
Ensure Node.js is installed on the system. You can download it from `nodejs.org`.

## Install Angular Cli 
Open a terminal or command prompt and run `npm install -g @angular/cli`
This way, npm is available to use.


## Install Dependencies
Navigate to the project directory and run `npm install`.
This command will read the package.json file and install all the dependencies listed there into a newly created node_modules folder.



## Development server
In command prompt or git bash, Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.
